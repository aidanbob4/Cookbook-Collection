In this project it allows you to add data from the cookbooks you have at home, including the categories and the recipes in those categories.

RECIPES:
For the recipes you are allowed to mark off if you have made it yet, put the page number it is found in, and a rating out of 10 if you have made it.

Categories:
Allows you to randomly select a recipe from that category, with the option of including the recipes you've already made or trying a brand new recipe!

VERSION UPDATES:
1.0 Initial Release!

1.1 Bug fixed a crash where if you tried randomizing a category after adding recipes it would create an error.
